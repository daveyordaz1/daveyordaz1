        <h2>Professional Organizations</h2>
        
        <p>In the pursuit of fostering diversity and inclusion within the computing industry, two prominent organizations stand out: the National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology (NCWIT) and the ACM-W (Association for Computing Machinery - Women in Computing). These organizations are dedicated to empowering and supporting women at every stage of their computing careers.</p>

 <p> <a href="https://ncwit.org/">NCWIT</a>
 NCWIT brings together industry leaders, educators, and researchers to increase the participation of girls and women in computing. Through initiatives like the Aspirations in Computing Awards and the NCWIT Academic Alliance, NCWIT provides resources, mentorship, and a platform for women to excel in computing fields. Their commitment to building a more inclusive tech workforce aligns perfectly with our mission to celebrate and elevate the contributions of women in computing.</p>

  <p> <a href="https://women.acm.org/">ACM-W</a>  ACM-W is the women's community of the ACM, the world's largest educational and scientific computing society. ACM-W focuses on advancing the understanding of women's contributions to computing and providing a supportive network for women in the field. They organize conferences, events, and activities that promote networking, skill development, and knowledge sharing. By recognizing the importance of diversity in computing, ACM-W actively contributes to a richer and more vibrant computing community.</p>

  <p> Both NCWIT and ACM-W play crucial roles in promoting gender diversity and equality in computing. Their efforts are not only shaping the industry today but also paving the way for a more inclusive and innovative future. We encourage you to explore their programs and events, and consider getting involved to make a difference in the world of computing.</p>
